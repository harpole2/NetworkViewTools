# NetworkViewTools
## R
 script to pull distances of optimal/suboptimal paths out of subopt(NetworkView program) file and plots histogram of distribution
 script to graph multiple betweenness fils between sources and sinks

## Python
scripts to calculate betweenness between a set of sources and sinks using the contact matrix from NetworkView

Also script to calculate betweenness between a sources within a distance of a residue and a sink using contact and distance matrix

Finally networkOccupancy.py is a function that allows you to make a contact map with definted residues in the choice variable, as well as the distance and fraction of the simulation that the residues need to be at that distance to make a contact. The optimized version uses a logical array rather than looping through frames. At the bottom is an example execution script.
